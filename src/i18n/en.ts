  faq: {
    title: "Frequently Asked Questions",
    questions: [
      {
        question: "Is POCS technology safe?",
        answer: "POCS technology is a fully validated minimally invasive technique that significantly reduces complication rates compared to traditional open surgery. Under professional operation, safety is very high. However, all surgeries carry certain risks, and detailed assessment and communication will be conducted before surgery."
      },
      {
        question: "How large stones can be treated with POCS technology?",
        answer: "In theory, POCS technology can handle gallstones of any size, as it can fragment stones under direct visualization. For larger stones (>1.5cm) or multiple stones, multiple treatments may be needed. The specific situation needs to be assessed based on the patient's imaging examination results."
      },
      {
        question: "How long after POCS surgery can I return to normal life?",
        answer: "Most patients can get out of bed and move around in 1-3 days after surgery, be discharged in 5-7 days, and resume normal life and light work in 2-4 weeks. Full recovery typically takes 1-2 months, during which strenuous exercise and overexertion should be avoided."
      },
      {
        question: "Will there be recurrence after POCS surgery?",
        answer: "POCS technology can effectively remove formed stones, but cannot change the patient's stone-forming constitution. Post-operative management combining medication, dietary adjustments, and regular follow-ups can significantly reduce the risk of recurrence. Dr. Liu will develop a personalized post-operative management plan for each patient."
      },
      {
        question: "What is the difference between POCS technology and traditional ERCP stone removal?",
        answer: "Traditional ERCP is 'blind' stone removal, with success rates limited by stone size and location; while POCS operates under direct visualization, providing more precise stone management. It is especially suitable for complex biliary stones, intrahepatic bile duct stones, and patients who have failed traditional methods."
      },
      {
        question: "Are all gallstone patients suitable for POCS technology?",
        answer: "Not all patients are suitable. Factors such as stone condition, patient age, and underlying diseases need to be comprehensively considered. It is recommended to visit a specialist clinic for detailed assessment to determine the most suitable treatment plan."
